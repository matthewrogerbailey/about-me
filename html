<h1>Hi, I'm <br>Matt</h1>

<h2>introduction</h2>

<p>At present I work for baskeys, which is local a Property Development, Property Management and Lettings Company, which owns a portfolio of over 200 student properties. <br>
I have the entire responsibility to manage 104 of these student properties, 394 tenants, for the full length of their tenancy from viewing to bond return. </p>

<h2>Where I'm From</h2>

<p>I live in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England. I have lived here all my life and think very highly of the city. It is not too large that it is a struggle to get around, you can easily walk from one side of the city centre to the other within 30 minuets. Although reletively small it still has an ample amount to see, including art garys, museums, cafes and plenty of bars/ nightlife venues. </p>

<p>I am looking to change courir and would relishing the chance to become a programmer.</p>
